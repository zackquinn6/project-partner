# User Data Isolation & Persistence Architecture

## Overview

Project Partner is designed to ensure each user has their own isolated data. This document verifies that user-specific and project run data is properly saved to the database.

## Data Isolation by User

### 1. Project Runs
**Table:** `project_runs`
**User Link:** `user_id` column

**Creation:**
- Created via `create_project_run_snapshot` RPC function
- Always sets `user_id` to authenticated user's ID
- Location: `ProjectActionsContext.tsx` line 206

**Retrieval:**
- Filtered by `user_id` in ProjectDataContext
- Query: `filters: [{ column: 'user_id', value: user.id }]`
- Location: `ProjectDataContext.tsx` line 336

**Updates:**
- Always filtered by both `id` AND `user_id`
- Query: `.eq('id', projectRun.id).eq('user_id', user.id)`
- Location: `ProjectActionsContext.tsx` line 735-736

**Data Saved Per Project Run:**
- ✅ `name`, `description`, `status`
- ✅ `completed_steps` - Array of completed step IDs
- ✅ `step_completion_percentages` - Percentage completion per step
- ✅ `progress` - Overall project progress (0-100)
- ✅ `initial_budget` - Budget set in kickoff step 3
- ✅ `initial_timeline` - Target date set in kickoff step 3
- ✅ `initial_sizing` - Project size set in kickoff step 3
- ✅ `budget_data` - Detailed budget line items and actual spending
- ✅ `project_photos` - Before/during/after photos
- ✅ `time_tracking` - Phase/operation/step time tracking
- ✅ `phase_ratings` - User ratings for completed phases
- ✅ `issue_reports` - Issues reported during project
- ✅ `survey_data` - Post-project survey responses
- ✅ `feedback_data` - Step-level feedback
- ✅ `schedule_events` - Scheduled tasks and events
- ✅ `shopping_checklist_data` - Ordered items tracking
- ✅ `customization_decisions` - Customization choices made
- ✅ `home_id` - Link to user's home

### 2. Homes
**Table:** `homes`
**User Link:** `user_id` column

**Creation:**
- Always sets `user_id: user.id`
- Location: `HomeManager.tsx` line 158

**Retrieval:**
- Filtered by `user_id`
- Query: `.eq('user_id', user.id)`
- Location: `HomeManager.tsx` line 80

**Updates:**
- Filtered by both `id` AND `user_id`
- Query: `.eq('id', editingHome.id).eq('user_id', user.id)`
- Location: `HomeManager.tsx` line 149

**Data Saved Per Home:**
- ✅ `name`, `city`, `state`
- ✅ `home_type`, `build_year`, `home_ownership`
- ✅ `purchase_date`, `notes`
- ✅ `is_primary` - Primary home flag
- ✅ `photos` - Array of photo URLs

### 3. Home Maintenance Tracker
**Tables:** `homes`, `user_maintenance_tasks`, `maintenance_completions`

**Architecture:** Each user has a unique set of maintenance data. Tasks are scoped by **home** (a user can have multiple homes). No sharing between users.

| Table | User link | Home scope | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `homes` | `user_id` | — | User’s homes (one-to-many) |
| `user_maintenance_tasks` | `user_id` | `home_id` FK → `homes` | Tasks per user, per home |
| `maintenance_completions` | `user_id` | `task_id` FK → `user_maintenance_tasks` | Completions per user, per task |

**Creation:**
- Homes: `user_id: user.id` (HomeManager)
- Tasks: `user_id`, `home_id` (selected home); insert only allowed for homes owned by the user (RLS)
- Completions: `user_id`, `task_id`; insert only allowed for tasks owned by the user (RLS)

**Retrieval:** All queries filter by `user_id` (and by `home_id` or task’s `home_id` where applicable). RLS enforces `auth.uid() = user_id` (and home/task ownership on insert).

**Security:** RLS is enabled on all three tables (migration `20250305000003_home_maintenance_rls_and_security.sql`). Policies restrict SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to the authenticated user’s rows; INSERT on tasks requires owning the home; INSERT on completions requires owning the task.

### 4. Tool Library
**Table:** `profiles` 
**Column:** `owned_tools` (JSONB array)
**User Link:** `user_id` column

**Retrieval:**
- Query: `.select('owned_tools').eq('user_id', user.id)`
- Location: `UserToolsEditor.tsx` line 129

**Updates:**
- Query: `.update({ owned_tools: ... }).eq('user_id', user.id)`
- Location: `UserToolsEditor.tsx` line 298

**Data Saved Per Tool:**
- ✅ `id`, `name`, `description`
- ✅ `photo_url` - Reference to admin library photo
- ✅ `user_photo_url` - User's custom photo
- ✅ `quantity`, `model_name`
- ✅ `custom_description` - User's personal notes
- ✅ `example_models`

### 5. Materials Library
**Table:** `profiles`
**Column:** `owned_materials` (JSONB array)
**User Link:** `user_id` column

**Data Saved Per Material:**
- ✅ `id`, `name`, `description`
- ✅ `photo_url` - Reference to admin library photo
- ✅ `user_photo_url` - User's custom photo
- ✅ `quantity`, `unit`, `unit_size`
- ✅ `brand`, `purchase_location`
- ✅ `custom_description` - User's personal notes

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All user-specific tables should have RLS policies enabled:

**Expected Policies:**
```sql
-- Project Runs: Users can only access their own
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own project runs"
  ON project_runs FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own project runs"
  ON project_runs FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Homes: Users can only access their own
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own homes"
  ON homes FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Profiles: Users can only access their own
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Data Persistence Verification

### Enhanced Logging (Added)

**Project Run Updates:**
- Logs user ID, project run ID, and key fields being saved
- Logs success/failure with detailed error messages
- Location: `ProjectActionsContext.tsx`

**Homes Fetching:**
- Logs user ID and email when fetching
- Logs count and home names retrieved
- Location: `HomeManager.tsx`

**Tools Operations:**
- Logs user ID when fetching and saving
- Logs tool names and counts
- Logs success/failure for each operation
- Location: `UserToolsEditor.tsx`

**Project Runs Fetching:**
- Logs user ID and email when initiating fetch
- Verifies filter is applied correctly
- Location: `ProjectDataContext.tsx`

## How to Verify User Data Isolation

### 1. Check Browser Console Logs

Look for these log patterns:
```
📊 ProjectDataContext - Fetching project runs for user: {userId: "...", userEmail: "..."}
🏠 HomeManager - Fetching homes for user: {userId: "...", userEmail: "..."}
🔧 UserToolsEditor - Fetching tools for user: {userId: "...", userEmail: "..."}
💾 ProjectActions - Saving project run to database: {userId: "...", ...}
✅ Tool saved successfully for user: ...
```

### 2. Test with Multiple Users

**Create two test accounts:**
1. Sign up as User A
2. Create homes, add tools, start projects
3. Sign out
4. Sign up as User B
5. Create different homes, tools, projects
6. Verify User B cannot see User A's data

### 3. Database Verification Queries

```sql
-- Verify project runs are user-specific
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as project_count
FROM project_runs
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Verify homes are user-specific
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as home_count
FROM homes
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Check a specific user's data
SELECT 
  pr.name as project_name,
  pr.user_id,
  pr.initial_budget,
  pr.initial_timeline,
  pr.completed_steps::jsonb->>0 as first_step,
  h.name as home_name
FROM project_runs pr
LEFT JOIN homes h ON pr.home_id = h.id
WHERE pr.user_id = 'specific-user-id';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User sees no data after signup

**Possible causes:**
1. User hasn't created any data yet (expected)
2. RLS policies blocking access (check policies)
3. user_id mismatch (check console logs for user ID)

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for log messages
- Verify user ID in logs matches database
- Check RLS policies in Supabase Dashboard

### Issue: User sees another user's data

**This should NEVER happen due to:**
1. All queries filtered by `user_id`
2. RLS policies at database level
3. No shared data between users

**If this occurs:**
- CRITICAL: Report immediately
- Check RLS policies are enabled
- Verify all queries have `.eq('user_id', user.id)`

## Data Flow Summary

```

    ↓
User ID assigned by Supabase Auth
    ↓
Profile created with user_id
    ↓
User creates/updates data:
    ├─ Homes → saved with user_id
    ├─ Tools → saved in profile.owned_tools (linked by user_id)
    ├─ Materials → saved in profile.owned_materials (linked by user_id)
    └─ Project Runs → saved with user_id
           ├─ initial_budget
           ├─ initial_timeline
           ├─ completed_steps
           ├─ budget_data
           ├─ project_photos
           ├─ time_tracking
           └─ all other project-specific data
    ↓
All retrievals filtered by user_id
    ↓
Each user sees only their own data ✅
```

## Conclusion

The application is properly designed with:
- ✅ User-specific data isolation
- ✅ Proper user_id filters on all operations
- ✅ Comprehensive data persistence
